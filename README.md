# python-api-challenge
## This is Module 6 Challenge. 

### Goal 1 : Create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator
* Use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the started code
* Create a scatter plot to showcase for Each Relationship.
* Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship.

### Goal 2 : Use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ Python skills to create map visualizations
*  Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame
*  Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition
*  For each city in the hotel_df DataFrame, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of your coordinates
*  Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map

### Attached folders and files :
* one folder including output data
* two jupyter notebook files
* one REDME file
